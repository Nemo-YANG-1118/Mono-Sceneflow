# Mono-Sceneflow
Code was written in 2014. If you can run this code and read the paper of " Richard Newcombe, Live dense reconstruction of a single camera", you will find that initial reconstruction by MSCSRBF is not really neccessary. If you have a good optical flow estimation, combine with some opengl trick, you can implement the dense mono reconstruction by monocular sceneflow algorithm. Besides, I left the interface of PCL's Poinsson Surface Reconstructio inside project so I can compare differences between Sceneflow and Poisson Reconstruction. Meanwhile I tried Liuche's optical flow code, you can compare it with Brox's optical flow. In my opinion, Brox's results should be better if viewpoint changing is obviously.
